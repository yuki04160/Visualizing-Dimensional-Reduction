# Visualizing Dimensional Reduction
To visualize high-dimensional dataset, I conducted an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, t-SNE, in Python using GitHub dataset [fashion-minst](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist), which is an image pixel dataset.
## Introduction
The same as PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, while t-SNE is a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm. Yet, both of them can be used for exploring high-dimensional data. Thus, this project aims to visualize high-dimensional data in two dimensions.
